## 3D gaussian splatting rendering
I forked and adapted an interesting project about a WebGL-powered 3D gaussian viewer, to visualize a "very appealing" bench in a little park here in Milan.
There are a lot of potential applications about this novel views syntesizer.

## Sub-pixel edge finder
The only pure python implementation of a subpixel edge location algorithm, fast and performant. The comparison below is with a standard Canny edge detector available in the OpenCV framework.
