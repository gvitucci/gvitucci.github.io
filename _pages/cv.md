Summary
======
My main role is **Vision Systems Engineer**, as I own expertise in both hardware and software components related to optoelectronics architectures and computer vision tasks.  
This role entails a deep understanding of physical optics, sensor technology as well as proficiency in image processing algorithms, software development, and system integration.


Work experience
======
* Thermofisher Scientific Srl (2025 - today)



* KursOrbital Srl (2024 - 2025): Computer Vision focused on developing and implementing innovative solutions that empower spacecraft to autonomously navigate, track and dock with specific targets. 



* IGOODI Srl (2023 - 2024): Computer Vision for Avatar related applications, including standard 2D (image segmentation, edge detection, elaboration, image classification with deep learning approaches) and 3D image processing (stereo vision, depth estimation, photogrammetry) and novel rendering methods (neural radiance fields, 3D gaussian splatting). 

  * **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB.
  * **Frameworks/tools**: OpenCV, Numpy, Pytorch, fast prototyping in Anaconda env., MATLAB Image processing Toolbox, Blender, MeshLab, YOLO-od, COLMAP
  * **Hardware**: RGB and IR Cameras, ToF cameras



* Optec SpA (2018 - 2023): R&D and test of VIS/ SWIR optoelectronic devices, mainly for space applications. 
  * **Languages**: Python, C++, MATLAB.
  *	**Frameworks/tools** : OpenCV, MATLAB Image Processing and Acquisition Toolbox,  C++ for Camera API development, firmware programming for motion controllers (ELMO MC, Arduino, Raspberry PI …)
  *	**Hardware**: Industrial camera integration (Basler/Ximea/Teledyne), like pixel size, bit depth, full well capacity, SNR; Linear and rotative motors control for focusing systems, micro-positioners, generic optoelectronics lab equipment. VIS, SWIR and IR full acquisition systems. Lens + camera MTF evaluation.


* Microla Optoelectronics (2013 - 2014):
Worked on LED illuminations systems and High-energy Passive Q-Switched Laser. Some lens design with ZEMAX, optoelectronics lab equipment.
