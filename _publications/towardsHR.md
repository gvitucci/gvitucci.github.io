IMAT is a new cold-neutron imaging facility at the neutron spallation source ISIS at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K.. The ISIS pulsed source enables energy-selective and energy-resolved neutron imaging via time-of-flight (TOF) techniques, which are available in addition to the white-beam neutron radiography and tomography options. A spatial resolution of about 50 μm for white-beam neutron radiography was achieved early in the IMAT commissioning phase. In this work we have made the first steps towards achieving higher spatial resolution. A white-beam radiography with 18 μm spatial resolution was achieved in this experiment. This result was possible by using the event counting neutron pixel detector based on micro-channel plates (MCP) coupled with a Timepix readout chip with 55 μm sized pixels, and by employing an event centroiding technique. The prospects for energy-selective neutron radiography for this centroiding mode are discussed.
